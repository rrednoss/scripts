#             - Content-Type:   Used to identify the media type of the content in the request body.
#             - Cookie:         The client can use the Cookie header to send previously stored cookies back to the server.

#             - POST            Submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
#             - PUT             Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
#             - TRACE           Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
